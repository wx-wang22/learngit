# bioinformatics Introduction
## Gene: Coding and Noncoding
### Essence of gene:
 A piece of information
### The counterintuitively small size of human genome:
- different kinds of RNAs
- a large portion of human DNA is non-coding while a great percentage of it will be transcribed
## Method: Sequencing and Computing
### 3 steps of bioinformatics:
1. information: medical or biological data
2. model: mathematical and probability model
3. algorithm: computational algorithm

|the general approach you will take|what you get when you run the algorithm over your training data|
You can generate a new model with the same algorithm but with different data, or you can get a new model from the same data but with a different algorithm.
## Learning plans:
- be more skilled in programming: read the recommended material on a regular basis after basic knowledge aquired
- be serious about in-class projects: make the most of assignments as a practice and work in a team
- use what I have learned in other courses as a tool for bioinformatics and vice versa
